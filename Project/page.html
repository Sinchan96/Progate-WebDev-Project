        </h2>
</center>
Tokyo Ghoul (Japanese: 東京喰種トーキョーグール, Hepburn: Tōkyō Gūru) is a Japanese dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Sui Ishida. It was serialized in Shueisha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Jump between September 2011 and September 2014, and it has been collected in fourteen tankōbon volumes as of August 2014. A sequel titled Tokyo Ghoul:re was serialized in the same magazine between October 2014 and July 2018, and was later collected into sixteen tankōbon volumes. A prequel titled Tokyo Ghoul [Jack] ran online on Jump Live.

A 12-episode anime television series adaptation by studio Pierrot aired on Tokyo MX between July 4, 2014, and September 19, 2014. A 12-episode second season, Tokyo Ghoul √A (pronounced Tokyo Ghoul Root A), which follows an original story, began airing on January 9, 2015, and concluded on March 27, 2015. In North America, Viz Media is publishing the manga while Funimation has licensed the anime series for streaming and home video distribution.

A live-action film based on the manga was released in Japan on July 29, 2017. An anime adaptation based on the sequel manga Tokyo Ghoul:re began airing from April 3, 2018, and concluded on December 25, 2018, with the series being split into two seasons.

    <center><h2>While popular manga such as Naruto and One Piece are our evergreens, a recent name that has become hugely popular is an anime as well as a manga series called Tokyo Ghoul.

        Written and illustrated by Ishida Sui, Tokyo Ghoul is set in a turbulent Tokyo where strange murders are happening and after analysing the evidence found at the crime scenes, the police conclude that the attacks have been conducted by “eater” ghouls. </h2></center>

   <center><h1>Tokyo Ghoul's First Season</h1></center>
   <center><h2>Studio Perriot's 2014 anime adaptation of Tokyo Ghoul was divisive. On one hand, it awkwardly condensed and rearranged the manga's plot, which long-time readers weren't happy about. On the other, it was able to adapt Ishida's story in a way that appealed to more people than ever. It was episode 12, "Ghoul," that really came to define the series. Studio Perriot put forth their best, perfectly recreating Kaneki's inner conflict, his iconic white hair shift and his fantastic battle against Jason. Overall, the season opened the floodgates for the Tokyo Ghoul fanbase, quickly making the anime one of the most popular of the year and eventually of all-time.
   
       There was also the opening. Unravel by Toru Kitajima (TK) took over the world for a while, introducing many to an exciting new side of Japanese music. In what may be TK's magnum opus, Unravel was a fantastic track tailor-made for Tokyo Ghoul, and it's a strong contender for the most popular anime opening of the 2010s  - with competition from Attack on Titan's Guren no Yumiya. Paired with powerful visuals playing into the credits of episode 12, Unravel was an important part of the Tokyo Ghoul freight train.</center>
   </h2>
<p>
    <center><h1>Tokyo Ghoul: Root A</h1></center>
</p><h2>
If Tokyo Ghoul started the train, Tokyo Ghoul: Root A was the trainwreck. Studio Perriot's time constraints and profit margins motivated huge changes to the manga plot as Tokyo Ghoul went into its second season. These changes made the anime hard to follow, losing the impact of the manga's great ending. Though it wasn't all bad. When viewed in a vacuum, some moments were adapted well and the series benefited from Yutaka Yamada's brilliant soundtrack, making the anime nice to listen to. The band Amazarashi also treated fans to a terrific ending theme and an acoustic rendition of Unravel.

Even if fans weren't pleased with the adaptation, Tokyo Ghoul: Root A was widely watched, and the fanbase kept growing. However, around this time the series entered some problematic territory. Reportedly, in China young people began imitating the "skin embroidery" of Juuzou Suzuya, one of the more popular characters in the series, by stitching patterns into their skin in a similar way. As this was self-harm, the trend was very controversial and Tokyo Ghoul was banned in China.

<h1>Tokyo Ghoul :Re</h1>

    </center>
</p>
<center><h2>Serialized between October 2014 and July 2018, Tokyo Ghoul :re was the highly-anticipated sequel to Tokyo Ghoul. Following his "death," Kaneki becomes an amnesiac Ghoul Investigator named Haise Sasaki. Captaining a squad of manufactured half-Ghouls, Kaneki confronts his past and the many unresolved plot points from the original manga. The manga had a strong first few volumes and Sui Ishida's dramatically improved artwork shone. Unfortunately, Iishida also experienced some serious motivation problems, detailed in the Tokyo Ghoul :re afterword. He overworked himself to such an extent that, like his protagonist, Ishida lost his sense of taste. Suffice to say, Tokyo Ghoul :re was noticeably rushed in its second half. Ishida refused to take a break from the manga, worrying he would disappoint fans by never returning. In the end, he finished well, but it was a bittersweet ending to the series.</h2></center>

            The Tokyo Ghoul :Re Anime
        </h1>
    </center>
</p>
<center>
    <h2>The series wasn't over yet, but this anime had fans wishing it was. Without exaggeration, the Tokyo Ghoul :re anime was one of the worst anime adaptations of the 2010s. Returning to the manga's plot after straying from it in Tokyo Ghoul: Root A left many people confused, and it only got harder to understand from there. Crunching down 179 chapters into 24 poorly-made episodes made for a thoroughly disappointing anime. Unlike Root A, Tokyo Ghoul :re didn't have the luxury of a few well-adapted moments, as the overall quality of its art, animation, and direction was far below the industry standard. Because of this, the two seasons of Tokyo Ghoul :re were unpopular and mostly unwatched - a sad end for the Tokyo Ghoul anime. The franchise isn't as popular as it once was, so chances of another adaptation are slim. Still, Tokyo Ghoul fans are hopeful for a remastered Tokyo Ghoul without Studio Perriot at the helm, similar to what happened to the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. </h2>
